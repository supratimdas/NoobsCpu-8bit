ASSEMBLER: noobsASM.pl
using the assembler is really simple:
noobsASM.pl <your-prog.asm>

it generates 2 output files:
- code.txt : a hex dump in human readable format, for the instruction memory
- data.txt : a hex dump in human readable format, for the data memory


FPGA MEMORY GENERATOR, for Lattice iCE40 FPGA
gen_fpga_mem.pl -input_file <code/data.txt output from assembler> -type <inst|data>
based on argument, generates:
inst_mem.v
data_mem.v

ready for instantiation

NOTE: the address starts at 0x00, so especially for data memory, output from cpu_addr must be subtracted by -8, since in 
the architecture the 1st 8 addresses are reserved
